Today, April 20, 2025, I had an amazing experience at GDG WOW! Here are some key highlights from the event:

- **Inspiring Sessions**: The event featured insightful talks on cutting-edge technologies like Model Context Protocol (MPC), Playwright for end-to-end testing, and advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). These sessions expanded my technical knowledge and inspired me to explore new possibilities in these domains.

- **Networking Opportunities**: I had the chance to connect with like-minded professionals and industry experts. The conversations were enriching and provided valuable perspectives on the latest trends in technology.

- **Innovation and Collaboration**: GDG WOW continues to be a platform that fosters innovation and collaboration, bringing together a community passionate about technology and growth.

I am truly grateful for this experience and am already looking forward to being part of it again next year. Thank you to the organizers and everyone who made this event a success!
